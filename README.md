It's 6pm. A time of day when the universal cry of 

>## *_"What's for dinner??!?!"_*

can be heard around the globe. No more quandries about what to cook. Open your fridge, then open the app! Enter the ingredients you have and, VOILA!, Lazy-Chef will find the recipe for you. I know what you are thinking:

>## *_"Now, if we could just teach it to cook as well..."_*

This web app was built in collaboration with Miriam Khaled and Papa Deere using

* Firebase
* AJAX
* Spoonacular API
* Google Maps API
* Materialize
* CSS
* HTML and of course, 
* JavaScript
* GitHub

Maybe, just maybe, you'll learn to love to cook.

This site was deployed using [GitHub Pages](https://avalabek.github.io/Lazy-Chef/).
